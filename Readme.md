# To do
### Open Ethereum Pools
- [ ] Create SA or **Mena nodes** for current coins' pools  
      ```
      work in progress
      ```
- [x] Add **estimated earnings 24h**  
      ```
      done, per worker and per miner
      ```
- [x] Add **Earnings last 1 Hour**
- [x] Add **Earnings last 24 hour**  
      ```
      done, copied [Open-ubiq-pool changes](https://github.com/mapleshadow/open-ubiq-pool/)
      ```
- [ ] Add selectable payout schema (**PPS**/**PPLNS**)
- [x] Add stratum 2.0.0 support - done
- [x] fix worker names to longer than 8 chars. (now 20)
- [x] add nicehash support to stratum - done
- [x] add graphing on backend for network hashrate, connected miners, connected workers, difficulty - done
- [x] fix the toHex build error - done
- [x] bring pool back to sourced from sammy repo, so all changes can be tracked backwards if needed for fresh builds - done 
- [ ] another payout schema
  - in which pool op defines period length, all shares and division amount of reward totals during round happen at end
- [ ] Add ping check with special stratum port, then direct to lowest ping
- [ ] Add helper for estimated earnings in USD, with BTC price from coinmarketcap and a config var to enable or disable the feature (for coins that are not listed yet, or show 0 if api doesn't work)
- [x] Add worker connected through which node  
      ```
      done, added value to redis
      ```
- [x] Add worker connected through which diff  
      ```
      done, added value to redis
      ```
- [ ] Add **Dynamic Difficulty** port
- [ ] Add **Solo Port** feature
- [x] Add **SSL** Stratum completed.
      ```
      can use STunnel for that purpose, maybe?
      ```
- [ ] Add **Pool Luck Feature** similar to
- [ ] Add and Enhance Code documentation
- [ ] Add **Multiple stratum region support for low latency**
- [ ] Add which worker found blocks ? and maybe on pool blocks page, add which miner found which block
- [ ] Add Email Monitoring, for rigs down to miner (maybe an outside service reading redis)
- [ ] Add Telegram notifications for downed rigs
- [ ] Make website description a variable from config, add few words per page
  - Unit: 'ATH',
  - CoinName: 'Atheios',
- [ ] Create PowerPoint slides (images) showing different components of running a pool and their interactions, services, dependencies, applications, configs, nodes, stratums â€¦ etc.  
      ```
      work in progress
      ```
- [x] Change references to explorer in hbs files, move to environment.js
  - block explorerlink.tx = ''
  - blockexplorerlink.blockhash = ''
  - blockexplorerlink.txhash = ''
  - blockexplorerlink.blocknumber = ''
  - blockexplorerlink.Uncle = ''  
    ```
    Done, moved these links to localization (languege) files
    ```
- [ ] eye candy data inserted into db
  - shares per worker / period (defined in json)
  - accepted, rejected, stale
  - blocks last 24 hours per miner
  - block finder, on which diff and server
- [ ] Pool Announcements: add announcements to the top of pools, get from json to be there on all pools with exclusion
- [ ] Complete Translation and add Korean
- [ ] On Miners list page, add most used server and diff per miner


### Other Ideas
- [ ] Enhance Pools **Homepages**
- [ ] Pool signup for Listing on coin pages automation
- [ ] Create an installation script/security script
- [ ] Create better methods to ease the install process, its very confusing for new pool ops.
  - Inputs to Consider
    - link to the geth file
    - name of coin
    - abbreviation
    - average block time
    - block reward
    - pool fee
    - RPC port
    -
- [ ] Create better log file analysis features, possibly stored into redis for an admin page.

# Server Security Notes
- Disable Redis listen `0.0.0.0`
- Disable SSH Port `22`
- Disable Login with `root`
- Disable Login with password
- Close All ports except necessary
- Close incoming SSH connections from `0.0.0.0` except from main servers
